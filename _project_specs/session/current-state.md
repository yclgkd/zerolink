# Current Session State

*Last updated: 2026-03-08*

## Active Task
Clarify sender delete, receiver-local plaintext burn, and channel expiry semantics across frontend UI and internal guidance.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Delete vs local burn vs expiry clarification implemented, ready for validation and PR
- **Progress**: Receiver UI now treats local plaintext burn as a delivered-substate only; sender and receiver terminal-state copy explicitly distinguishes sender deletion from TTL expiry; `.ai/` and `_project_specs/` guidance no longer describe decrypt as implicit link burn.
- **Blocking Issues**: None

## What Was Done

### Phase 9: Delete vs local burn vs expiry clarification
- `packages/frontend/src/stores/decrypt-store.ts` — Renamed the receiver-only burn flag to `localPlaintextBurned` so it cannot be confused with channel state
- `packages/frontend/src/components/share/share-steps.tsx` — Updated delivered, deleted, expired, and local-burn copy so the receiver page clearly separates local plaintext removal from channel terminal states
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/ManagePage.tsx` — Replaced user-facing `Destroy` language with `Delete`, and clarified deleted vs expired sender terminal copy
- `packages/frontend/src/__tests__/share-page.test.tsx` — Added assertions that local burn is device-only and that deleted/expired pages use distinct actor and lifetime wording
- `packages/frontend/src/__tests__/manage-page.test.tsx` — Added assertions for `Delete Channel`, `Confirm Delete`, `Deleting...`, and updated deleted/expired copy
- `packages/frontend/e2e/happy-path.spec.ts` — Kept the local burn followed by re-decrypt flow and made the device-only semantics explicit
- `.ai/project-context.md` / `.ai/architecture.md` — Removed decrypt-as-burn wording and narrowed backend guarantees to terminal-state enforcement
- `_project_specs/session/decisions.md` / `_project_specs/todos/*.md` — Replaced read-implies-channel-burn terminology with explicit delete/local-burn/expiry semantics

## Previous Work

### Phase 1: Shared Package
- `packages/shared/src/constants.ts` — Added `QUICK` and `SECURE` to `SECURITY_PROFILE`; legacy values retained
- `packages/shared/src/types.ts` — Extended `AdminMode` to include `'password'`; added `CreateFinishPasswordRequest`; updated `SoftkeyCompoundCommitRequest.adminMode` to `'password' | 'softkey'`
- `packages/shared/src/schemas.ts` — Added `quick/secure` to `SecurityProfileSchema`; `AdminModeSchema` includes `'password'`; added `CreateFinishPasswordSchema`; `SoftkeyCompoundCommitRequestSchema` uses `z.enum(['password', 'softkey'])`
- `packages/shared/src/__tests__/schemas.test.ts` — 191 tests pass

### Phase 2: Backend
- `packages/backend/src/do/SecretVaultTypes.ts` — `SoftkeyCompoundCommitParams.adminMode: 'password' | 'softkey'`
- `packages/backend/src/do/SecretVault.ts` — `commitCreate` handles `'password'` same as `'softkey'`; removed hardware_only attestation enforcement; UV required for `secure/strict/hardware_only`; compound path uses `isPasswordMode = adminMode === 'password' || adminMode === 'softkey'`
- `packages/backend/src/crypto/webauthn.ts` — `generateCreationOptions` accepts `securityProfile: string`; strict UV/RK for `secure/strict/hardware_only`; always `attestation: 'none'`
- `packages/backend/src/do/__tests__/SecretVault.test.ts` — Updated 3 tests for removed attestation enforcement; 111 tests pass

### Phase 3: Frontend Crypto
- `packages/frontend/src/crypto/webauthn.ts` — `SECURE/STRICT/HARDWARE_ONLY` all get `UV=required, RK=required, attestation=none`; `QUICK` and `STANDARD` allow fallback
- `packages/frontend/src/crypto/orchestrator.ts` — `createFinish` uses `adminMode: 'password'`; deliver/delete treat `'password' || 'softkey'` as password mode

### Phase 4: Frontend UI
- `packages/frontend/src/components/create/security-profile-card.tsx` — Added `quick` and `secure` configs; legacy configs kept with "(Legacy)" suffix
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/CreatePage.tsx` — Complete rewrite: 2-mode selector (Quick/Secure), `QuickSharePasswordPanel`, no more CompatibilityPanel/DowngradeDialog

### Phase 5: Tests
- `packages/frontend/src/__tests__/create-page.test.tsx` — Full rewrite for new 2-mode UI (19 tests)
- `packages/frontend/src/__tests__/security-profile-card.test.tsx` — Updated titles to include "(Legacy)"
- `packages/frontend/src/__tests__/webauthn-adapter.test.ts` — Updated hardware_only policy expectations

### Phase 6: Documentation
- `docs/PRD.md` → Updated to v3.0; Section 4 replaced with Quick/Secure; Section 9 updated; Appendix G & I updated
- `_project_specs/session/decisions.md` → Added decision entry for security mode restructuring

2. [ ] Review diff for wording regressions and stale delete-vs-local-burn copy
3. [ ] Create PR with validation notes
